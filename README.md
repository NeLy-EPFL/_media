This repository is for larger media files (eg. GIFs/videos on the README). You might not want to have add these files to the main Git repositories of the respective projects because it will make them bulkier and slower to clone. Instead, put the files in this repository and use links to display the videos/images.

This repository was originally created by Sibo for the FlyGym package.
